# Intro

## Welcome to Official Fireck Documentation! ðŸ”¥

**Fireck** is a firebase headless cms that you deploy on your netlify account and connect with your firebase project.

Fireck can rebuild itself with new environment variables and it makes possible to impact the code of the app inside the application.

You donâ€™t need to care about linking your storage service because firebase already has a storage in contrast with strapi headless cms.

Your app is always up and responds quickly in contrast with heroku free tier applications.

Although, your app is limited to the hosting provider and the firebase limits of free plan. To scale your application, you will need to take care of upgrading your plans on the netlify and firebase websites.
