# Installation

## Step 1

Deploy the app to Netlify.
Everything will be configurable inside the app.

## Step 2

Connect the app with your firebase project by uploading a service account file. Give some time for the app to rebuild with new environment variables. Watch the video below how to find your service account file:

## Step 3

Enable the firestore and authentication in your [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). After enabling, it will take some time for changes to propagate. If you don't see any changes, refresh the app.
